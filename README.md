# DSAM 3000 Palimpsest
> Palimpsest for work on project for Digital Studies and Methods Seminar.
### Capta
- Inclusions: text and images relating to the word “Canaima”, from Instagram, TripAdvisor and Google Reviews in the past 5 years, that show its use in a day-to-day context. In the most part, “Canaima” refers to Canaima National Park, which has been a hub for picturesque tourism in Venezuela in recent years, as well as restaurants and food trucks around the globe that have popped up recently as a result of Venezuelan migration. Given these characteristics, and also for how their user experience is molded around text and images, it makes sense to draw the data from Instagram, TripAdvisor and Google Reviews.
- Exclusions: Canaima used outside of a day-to-day context 
    - Literary histories about Canaima. There is a rich line of literary work about the area of Canaima, many of them written before the space was institutionalized as a national park.
    - Hollywood representations. Content from movies such as Up! and Point Break where Canaima appears.

### Hypothesis / thesis / research question
What sentiments are exported from Canaima National Park? How are these sentiments historically and materially racialized and/or gendered in relation to Indigenous peoples living in the area molded by extraction, global capitalism, neoimperialism and data colonialism?

### Tools / techniques
We need tools / techniques that will allow to consider these text and images as proxies for racialized affects / sentiments. At the current moment, computers are really good at detecting sentiments from text but really bad at detecting sentiments from images (or at least they require a lot of human help). Therefore, this captaset will be best served by sentiment analysis, a natural language processing technique detects the polarity of a text (positive, negative, neutral), its underlying emotions (happy, sad, angry, etc.), intentions (interested, not interested), etc. 

Based on the results of the sentiment analysis, the images of the texts considered most representative of the sentiment, as well as those corresponding to interesting outliers, can help situate these sentiments using non-digital tools (methodologies from Indigenous Studies, Critical Infrastructure Studies, Environmental Humanities, Feminist Studies, Venezuelan Studies). In short, sentiment analysis can allow us to provide starting points through which we can contextualize the racialized aspects of these affects in terms of their material histories.
